\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Scope of the Project}
    My objective for this project was to learn about the brand new field of categorical systems theory
    , which applies the pure math field of category theory to the study of arbitrary systems
    , and then use the tools that I learned to model a complex real-world system.

    \vspace*{0.25in}

    But I didn't know category theory or any complex systems...

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The Actual Scope of the Project}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Learn Category Theory
        \item Learn Categorical Systems Theory
        \item Write a software package for it in Python
        \item Learn about a real world system (Transcription Networks)
        \item Model it and simulate the results
        \item Live to tell you all about it
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Scope of this Presentation}
    Keep things high-level and descriptive and move fast.

    \vspace*{0.125in}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Tell you what a system is.
        \item Tell you what a category is.
        \item Tell you how they can work together.
        \item Show you a complex system and how I modeled it.
        \item Talk about the simulation results.
    \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{What is a System?}
    Probably the simplest way to think of a system is as a box with information coming in and information coming out, and with these two information streams being connected by feedback.

\begin{frame}{What is a System?}
    Let's make this more precise.
    \vspace*{0.125in}
    \begin{definition}[System]
        A system is a collection of states and a pair of functions on those states that
        (1) expose some of the internal state to the outside world and
        (2) update the system's state based on the system's current state and current inputs.
