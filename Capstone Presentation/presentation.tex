\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Scope of the Project}
    My objective for this project was to learn about the brand new field of categorical systems theory
    , which applies the pure math field of category theory to the study of arbitrary systems
    , and then use the tools that I learned to model a complex real-world system.

    \vspace*{0.25in}

    But I didn't know category theory or any complex systems...
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{The Actual Scope of the Project}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Learn Category Theory
        \item Learn Categorical Systems Theory
        \item Write a software package for it in Python
        \item Learn about a real world system (Transcription Networks)
        \item Model it and simulate the results
        \item Live to tell you all about it
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Scope of this Presentation}
    Keep things high-level and descriptive and move fast.

    \vspace*{0.125in}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Tell you what a system is.
        \item Tell you what a category is.
        \item Tell you how they can work together.
        \item Show you a complex system and how I modeled it.

\begin{frame}{What is a System?}
    A system is a thing that changes. At it's simplest, a system consists of the following two things.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A set of states that the system can be in.
        \item A map that updates the system's state based on the state that it's currently in.
    \end{enumerate}

    \end{center}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Examples of Systems}
    The set of natural numbers with the successor function is a system.
    \vspace*{0.125in}
    \[
        S: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}
    \]
    \[
        \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \mapsto n+1
    \]
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Examples of Systems}
    An ordinary differential equation is also a system.
    \vspace*{0.125in}
    \[
        \frac{dx}{dt}=\kappa x
    \]
    Here the set of states is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and the update map is the differential equation itself: given the current state, $x$, the differential equation tells us how to change it.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What's the Problem}
    The problem with these systems is that they're closed.

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    They don't interact with each other. And they don't interact with their environment.

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    So let's open them up with category theory.
\end{frame}

\section{Categories}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Category Theory Basics}
    Category theory is a theory of structure and composition.

    \vspace*{0.25in}
    It uses the mathematical object of a category to encapsulate the notion of associative composition.

    \vspace*{0.25in}
    With this alone it creates a language capable of formalizing all of mathematics.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What is a Category?}
    \begin{definition}[Category]
        A category $\mathcal{C}$ is defined by the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\mathcal{C}$ contains a collection of objects $\mathsf{ob}(\mathcal{C})$.
            \item For any two objects $a$, $b$ $\in \mathcal{C}$ there is a collection of morphisms, $f:a \rightarrow b$, between those objects called the homset, $\mathcal{C}(a,b)$ .
            \item Every object $a\in \mathcal{C}$ has a morphism to itself $\mathsf{id}_a:a\rightarrow a$ called its identity.
            \item For every two morphisms $f:a\rightarrow b$ and $g: b\rightarrow c$ there's a third morphism $g\circ f:a\rightarrow c$ that's their composition.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is a Category?}
    These objects and morphisms are then under two constraints: unitality and associativity.
    \begin{definition}[Category cont. Unitality]
        Any morphism $f:a\rightarrow b$ can be composed with the identity morphisms of $a$ and $b$ such that $f\circ \mathsf{id}_a=\mathsf{id}_b\circ f=f$.
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
                a && b \\
                \\
                a && b
                \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
                \arrow["{\mathsf{id}_a}"', from=1-1, to=3-1]
                \arrow["{\mathsf{id}_b}", from=1-3, to=3-3]
                \arrow["f"', from=3-1, to=3-3]
            \end{tikzcd}\]
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is a Category?}
    These objects and morphisms are then under two constraints: unitality and associativity.
    \begin{definition}[Category cont. Associativity]
        For any morphisms $f:a\rightarrow b$, $g:b\rightarrow c$, and $h:c\rightarrow d$, $h\circ (g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$. Since it doesn't matter what order we apply the morphisms, we write this $h\circ g \circ f$.
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
                a & b & c & d
                \arrow["f"', from=1-1, to=1-2]
                \arrow["g"', from=1-2, to=1-3]
                \arrow["h"', from=1-3, to=1-4]
                \arrow["{{g\circ f}}", curve={height=-24pt}, from=1-1, to=1-3]
                \arrow["{{h\circ g}}"', curve={height=24pt}, from=1-2, to=1-4]
            \end{tikzcd}\]
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Monoidal Categories}
%    To build systems compositionally we'll also need a way to place them in parallel.
%
%    \vspace*{0.125in}
%    Similar to a binary operation on a set, we can have a binary operation on a category.
%
%    \vspace*{0.125in}
%    This construction is captured in the notion of a monoidal category.
%\end{frame}
%
%
%\begin{frame}{Monoidal Categories}
%    \begin{definition}[Monoidal Categories]
%        A category $\mathcal{C}$ is monoidal if the following exist.
%        \begin{enumerate}
%            \item A functor $\otimes:\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{C}$ called the monoidal product.
%            \item An object $\mathbbm{1}\in\mathcal{C}$ called the unit.
%            \item A natural isomorphism $\alpha : (a\otimes b)\otimes c\Rightarrow a\otimes (b\otimes c)$ called the associator, with components $\alpha_{x,y,z}: (x\otimes y)\otimes z\rightarrow x\otimes (y\otimes z)$.
%            \item A natural isomorphism $\lambda : \mathbbm{1}\otimes a\Rightarrow a$ called the left unitor with components $\lambda_x : \mathbbm{1}\otimes x\rightarrow x$.
%            \item A natural isomorphism $\rho : a\otimes \mathbbm{1}\Rightarrow a$ called the right unitor with components $\lambda_x : x\otimes \mathbbm{1}\rightarrow x$.

\section{Composing Systems}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{What is a Open System?}
    An open system is as a system with an interface.

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{system_diagram_open.png}
    \end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Lenses and Arenas}
    To model this mathematically we'll use objects called arenas and morphisms called lenses.

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    \begin{definition}[Arenas]
        An arena is a pair of objects $\begin{pmatrix}A \\ B\end{pmatrix}$ from an underlying category.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}
        A lens is a morphism between arenas made from a pair of morphisms from the underlying category
        $$\begin{pmatrix}f \\ g\end{pmatrix}: \begin{pmatrix}A \\ B\end{pmatrix} \leftrightarrows \begin{pmatrix}C \\ D\end{pmatrix}$$
        where $f:B\rightarrow D$ is the output map and $g:B\times C \rightarrow A$ is the update map.
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What this Gives Us}
    Arenas and lenses between them form a monoidal category.

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    This means that we can compose lenses and multiply them.

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    By modeling our open systems as lenses, composition of lenses lets us place systems in series and multiplication of lenses lets us place systems in parallel.
