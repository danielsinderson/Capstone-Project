    \frametitle{Scope of the Project}
    My objective for this project was to learn about the brand new field of categorical systems theory
    , which applies the pure math field of category theory to the study of arbitrary systems
    , and then use the tools that I learned to model a complex real-world system.

    But I didn't know category theory or any complex systems...

    \frametitle{The Actual Scope of the Project}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Learn Category Theory
        \item Learn Categorical Systems Theory
        \item Write a software package for it in Python
        \item Learn about a real world system (Transcription Networks)
        \item Model it and simulate the results
        \item Live to tell you all about it
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Scope of this Presentation}
    Keep things high-level and descriptive and move fast.

    \vspace*{0.125in}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Tell you what a system is.
        \item Tell you what a category is.
        \item Tell you how they can work together.
        \item Show you a complex system and how I modeled it.
        \item Talk about the simulation results.
    \end{enumerate}
