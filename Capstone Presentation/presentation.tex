    \frametitle{Goal of the Project}
    \begin{large}
        My objective for this project was to learn about the field of categorical systems theory,
        which applies the pure math field of category theory to the study of arbitrary systems,
        and then use what I learned to model a real-world system.

\begin{frame}{What is a System?}
    \begin{large}
        A system is a thing that changes. At its simplest, a system consists of the following two things.

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item A set of states that the system can be in.
            \item A map that updates the system's state based on the state that it's currently in.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{large}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Examples of Systems}
    \begin{large}
        The set of natural numbers with the successor function is a system.
        \vspace*{0.125in}
        \[
            S: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}
        \]
        \[
            \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ n \mapsto n+1
        \]
    \end{large}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Examples of Systems}
    \begin{large}
        An ordinary differential equation is also a system.
        \vspace*{0.125in}
        \[
            \frac{dx}{dt}=\kappa x
        \]
        Here the set of states is the set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ and the update map is the differential equation itself given some initial condition $x_0$.

    \end{large}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What's the Problem}
    \begin{large}
        The problem with these systems is that they're closed.

        \vspace*{0.25in}
        They don't interact with each other, and they don't interact with their environment.

        \vspace*{0.25in}
        So let's open them up with category theory.

\begin{frame}{Category Theory Basics}
    \begin{large}
        Category theory is a theory of associative composition.

        \vspace*{0.25in}
        It's very general, and this generality allows it to encapsulate much of the high level structure in other theories.

        \vspace*{0.25in}
        This gives us a common formalism for working with the abstract structural features found across a multitude of diverse phenomena, both inside and outside of pure mathematics.

    \end{large}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What is a Category?}
    \begin{definition}[Category]

        \vspace*{0.125in}
        A category $\mathcal{C}$ is defined by the following:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item $\mathcal{C}$ contains a collection of objects $\mathsf{ob}(\mathcal{C})$.
            \item For any two objects $a$, $b$ $\in \mathcal{C}$ there is a collection of morphisms, $f:a \rightarrow b$, between those objects called the homset, $\mathcal{C}(a,b)$ .
            \item Every object $a\in \mathcal{C}$ has a morphism to itself $\mathsf{id}_a:a\rightarrow a$ called its identity.
            \item For every two morphisms $f:a\rightarrow b$ and $g: b\rightarrow c$ there's a third morphism $g\circ f:a\rightarrow c$ that's their composition.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is a Category?}

        \vspace*{0.125in}
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
                A && B && C \\
                \\
                && X

            \end{tikzcd}\]
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is a Category?}
    These objects and morphisms are then under two constraints: unitality and associativity.
    \begin{definition}[Category cont. Unitality]
        Any morphism $f:a\rightarrow b$ can be composed with the identity morphisms of $a$ and $b$ such that $f\circ \mathsf{id}_a=\mathsf{id}_b\circ f=f$.
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
                a && b
                \arrow["{\mathsf{id}_a}"', from=1-1, to=1-1, loop, in=215, out=145, distance=10mm]
                \arrow["f", from=1-1, to=1-3]
                \arrow["{\mathsf{id}_b}", from=1-3, to=1-3, loop, in=325, out=35, distance=10mm]
            \end{tikzcd}\]
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]{What is a Category?}
    These objects and morphisms are then under two constraints: unitality and associativity.
    \begin{definition}[Category cont. Associativity]
        For any morphisms $f:a\rightarrow b$, $g:b\rightarrow c$, and $h:c\rightarrow d$, $h\circ (g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$. Since it doesn't matter what order we apply the morphisms, we write this $h\circ g \circ f$.
        \[\begin{tikzcd}
                a & b & c & d
                \arrow["f"', from=1-1, to=1-2]
                \arrow["g"', from=1-2, to=1-3]

                \arrow["{{h\circ g}}"', curve={height=24pt}, from=1-2, to=1-4]
            \end{tikzcd}\]

\begin{frame}{What is a Open System?}
    \begin{large}
        An open system is as a system with an interface.

    \end{large}

    \vspace*{0.25in}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{system_diagram_open.png}
    \end{center}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Lenses and Arenas}
    \begin{large}
        To model this mathematically we'll use objects called arenas and morphisms called lenses.

    \end{large}

    \vspace*{0.125in}
    \begin{definition}[Arenas]
        An arena is a pair of objects $\begin{pmatrix}A \\ B\end{pmatrix}$ from an underlying category.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{definition}[Lenses]
        \vspace*{0.125in}

        A lens is a morphism between arenas made from a pair of morphisms from the underlying category
        $$\begin{pmatrix}f \\ g\end{pmatrix}: \begin{pmatrix}A \\ B\end{pmatrix} \leftrightarrows \begin{pmatrix}C \\ D\end{pmatrix}$$
        where $g:B\rightarrow D$ is the output map and $f:B\times C \rightarrow A$ is the update map.
    \end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{What this Gives Us}
    \begin{large}
        Arenas and lenses between them form a monoidal category.

        \vspace*{0.125in}
        This means that we can compose systems and multiply them.

        \vspace*{0.125in}
        By modeling our open systems as lenses, composition of lenses lets us place systems in series and multiplication of lenses lets us place systems in parallel.

    \end{large}

\begin{frame}{Gene Transcription}
    \begin{large}
        Gene transcription is the process by which genes in a cell’s DNA produce proteins.

        \vspace*{0.125in}
        The dynamics of this process for a single gene are well modeled by the following differential equation.
        $$\frac{dY}{dt}=\beta f(X^*) - \alpha Y$$

        $$\text{Activator: } \ f_A(X^*)=\frac{\beta X^{*n}}{K^n + X^{*n}} \ \text{ or } \ \beta * P(X^* > K)$$
        $$\text{Repressor: } \ f_R(X^*)=\frac{\beta}{1 + \left(\frac{X^*}{K}\right)^n} \ \text{ or } \ \beta * P(X^* < K)$$

    \end{large}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motor Flagella Network}
    \begin{large}
        Gene transcription network are connected networks of genes whose products act as transcription factors for other genes.

        \vspace*{0.125in}
        Below is the motor flagella network of \textit{e. coli} bacteria.

\begin{frame}{Where did all the Category Theory Go?}
    \begin{large}
        It's inside the wiring diagrams.

        \vspace*{0.25in}
        Diagrammatic languages are more intellectually tractable.

        \vspace*{0.25in}
        They are easier to reason about for both the designer or modeler and those they are designing or modeling for.

\begin{frame}{What's Next?}
    \begin{large}
        Lenses over other cartesian categories: $\textbf{Set}$, $\textbf{Man}$

        \vspace*{0.25in}
