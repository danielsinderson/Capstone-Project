This repository is the dumping ground for my undergraduate mathematics capstone on using category theory to model open systems. I used the formalism laid out in David Jaz Myer's preprint [here](http://davidjaz.com/Papers/DynamicalBook.pdf) and the AlgebraicJulia library to model a transcription network motif called a multi-output feedforward loop.
