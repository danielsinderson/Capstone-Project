  annotate  = {This book is not for the faint of heart. It is, without hesitation, the most difficult book I've ever read. Riehl's definitions are detailed, clear, and rigorous, but she expects a lot of mathematical maturity from the reader. This really becomes apparent in her examples, within which she assumes a deep understanding of all of undergraduate mathematics. This book is the syllabus and the test: it tells me what I need to know and tells me, in no uncertain terms, if I actually know it. The other books are the lectures where I actually learn the concepts.}

  author    = {Cheng, Eugenia},
  year      = {2022},
  publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
  annotate  = {\textit{The Joy of Abstraction} provides a gentle yet rigorous tour of category theory by first building up some intuition with non-mathematical concepts, then surveying common mathematical structures from ungraduate mathematics as categories, and then presenting the real (formal) definitions of the basic concepts of the theory. This book is a perfect introduction and companion volume to the richer, more advanced texts.}

  annotate  = {This is a large book covering much more than basic category theory, but the first three chapters provide an excellent primer on the fundamentals. It's a bit older so some of the notation is different and the topics covered are slightly different. This is a good thing though! The inclusion of arrow categories and comma categories in chapter two gives a different perspective on functor categories and categories of (co)cones that I found useful.  }

  annotate  = {\textit{Sets for Mathematics} has been good for its longer explanations of concepts and the fact that it's all happening in \textbf{Set}, which is familiar from last term. It does use different terminology sometimes. This can be bad because it's confusing, but it can also be a good test of my understanding of the underlying math instead of my understanding of terminology.}

The pace and the explanations are great though, at least in the first couple of chapters. The difficulty ramps up a lot by the end of chapter two.}
